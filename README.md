# Files Explained :
1) dataCollection.py - To collect the moods/gestures (data) using mediapipe framework with corresponding labels.
2) dataTraining.py - To train the model with moods/gestures and corresponding labels using keras‚Äô models.Model, compile, fit, layers.Input, layers.Dense
3) recommend.py - Using Streamlit to create a user interface (local) and to recommend songs depending on the mood/gesture detected. Songs were recommended using conditions for different moods.
4) .npy - dataset for each expression/gesture (400 images)

# Challenges faced (ML background) :
1)  Forced to establish a user interface within a night, due to unforseen circumstances.
2)  Unstable server connection on streamlit
3)  Adapted to situation quickly and was able to create a local interface.
